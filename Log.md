# Team No Wei Log #

## Febraury 9th, 2017
### General 
This was our first meeting of Team No Wei to work on this project. 
We analyzed the requirements of the first checkpoints and decided that Github Issues with Labels and Milestones would be the best implementation of synchronization between us. 
We first created all of the milestones corresponding to the dates that are in the rubric. 
In order to keep Team No Wei on track, we implemented a system of issues and assignees to implement the functionality.
All information about the required implementation and code is linked to every issue. 
Each commit will be tagged with the issue that attempts to resolve the issue. For more information look at our issues and each commit that solves the issue will be tagged with the commit ID. 

### Database API
We completed the entirety of the Database API that we will be giving to another team. 
More information about the internal functionality is documented in the Visual Studio 2015 C++ code.  
We implemented the database API in the following format:

##### Database Library
- Classes
  - Database
    - Query
  - Table
  - Record
  
### Standards
Furthermore, we came to an agreement on coding practices and standards.
- We implemented a system of buddying code prior to any commit. 
- The requirement before pushing code is that another member of the team must approve and fully understand the changes.
- We will be implementing camel case and other coding practices that we learned in class. 
- Most likely, we will be implementing some form of Git Flow in our project.
- In order to work on an issue, the issue must be assigned to you and all commits must be regarding that issue. 
- In order to close the issue, another member of the team must review all changes and ensure that they pass the requirements.
